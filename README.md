This tool embodies the core principles of the Cyber Wardens program: simplifying cybersecurity for everyone. 
It generates strong, random passwords and passphrases based on current best practices.

### Password Categories
Choose the category that best fits your account. The recommended lengths are based on Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) guidelines.

- üîê Password (15+ chars): Ideal for most new accounts. A mix of letters, numbers, and symbols for high-entropy security.
- üîë Passphrase (3-4+ words): A set of random words that are easy to remember but incredibly hard for a computer to guess. Recommended by ACSC for memorability.
- üî¢ PIN Code: A numerical-only code for devices, bank cards, or other systems with number-only requirements.

### Cyber Wardens Principles
- Simplicity: We remove the guesswork with clear, categorized options.
- Focus on High-Impact Actions: Creating a strong password is one of the most effective steps you can take.
- Encourage Good Habits: This tool promotes the use of unique, strong passwords for every account.

Always use a password manager to store your generated passwords securely.
### Variations

In the interest of usability as well as cross-platform availability, the concept project aimed to create 3 kinds of scripted utilities that I believe would be highly beneficial as quick callout tools to secure things like emails, social media accounts, bank accounts, cloud storage instances, networks, portals, web server configs, system configs, VPN connections, among a varied list of usages. To make the utility script readily available system wide, iit is encouraged that aliasing or shortcut keybindings could be leveraged for direct ease of access and use as per user's required workflow engagements/use of desktop applications.

### Project Limitations

At present Still researching the potential of making the script into part of a desktop security suite that would also include the potential viable secure storage of constantly used credentials. This still is a work of progress while I am struggling as we all do with life's trials and tribulations. Suggestions for further improvements are welcome and encouraged.
