This tool embodies the core principles of the Cyber Wardens program: simplifying cybersecurity for everyone. 
It generates strong, random passwords and passphrases based on current best practices.

### Password Categories
Choose the category that best fits your account. The recommended lengths are based on Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) guidelines.

- 🔐 Password (15+ chars): Ideal for most new accounts. A mix of letters, numbers, and symbols for high-entropy security.
- 🔑 Passphrase (3-4+ words): A set of random words that are easy to remember but incredibly hard for a computer to guess. Recommended by ACSC for memorability.
- 🔢 PIN Code: A numerical-only code for devices, bank cards, or other systems with number-only requirements.

### Cyber Wardens Principles
- Simplicity: We remove the guesswork with clear, categorized options.
- Focus on High-Impact Actions: Creating a strong password is one of the most effective steps you can take.
- Encourage Good Habits: This tool promotes the use of unique, strong passwords for every account.

Always use a password manager to store your generated passwords securely.
